# Background
Parental leave is essential for promoting the well-being of children, supporting gender equality, and enabling individuals to fulfil their responsibilities as parents while maintaining their professional lives. It has positive effects on families, workplaces, and society as a whole. The analysis of parental leave data shows a significant difference between the paid/unpaid and maternity/paternity leaves offered, indicating a huge disparity between the pay scale and the gender role respectively.

# Objective
We have been provided with crowdsourced parental leave data from 1,601 companies across different industries, including paid/unpaid maternity and paternity leave weeks. Using this data set we have to generate useful insights like which companies offer the most parental leave, the difference between maternity & paternity leave, the distribution of leave and any noticeable differences between them.

# Solution
To address and curb parental leave disparities organizations and companies should take comprehensive measures to ensure a healthy work-life balance. By providing equal leave policies, increased leave duration, combatting stereotypes and biases, flexible return to work arrangements and regular feedback reports would help the companies to promote a healthier work environment, thereby, increasing productivity of the companies.
